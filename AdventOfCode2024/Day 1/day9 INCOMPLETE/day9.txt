the first example above, 2333133121414131402, represents these individual 
blocks:

00...111...2...333.44.5555.6666.777.888899

for i in range(0, len(input), 2):
    for j in range(0, int(input[i])):
        print i//2
    
    for j in range(0, int(input[i+1])):
        print('.')

instead of trying to swap the two chars, create a new string and append new 
values to it. If no swap, append from left, if swap, append from right.
