'''
what is the difference between starting at 9 vs starting from 1? If
'''
Need a dictionary with number and coordinate
Start from each nine
Method 1: grow area to each UDLR spot that is one beneath it.
Starting from given nine:
My_func(num==9, travelMap, trailheadMap)
If num==1:
		If any(UDLR == 1): return trailheadMap incremented at that position
Else:
		If any(UDLR == num): return mask of travelMap where only num is present
			My_funct(num-1, travelMap, trailheadMap)
		Else: break

		Continue this, essentially growing the map if possible starting at each non zero number, (if not possible break)
# by setting the trail to 1’s, UDLR check can work by first checking it’s a zero (therefore, for sure checking something that has not been explored before).

I will need to go through each starting point, initalising an emtpy map with a one at the starting point
then apply the function to descend the hill.
if not empty, continue each iteration.
 
		 
Method 2: Recursion and trees (?)
